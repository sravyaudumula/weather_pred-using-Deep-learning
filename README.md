# ðŸŒ¦ Weather Prediction using Deep Learning

This project predicts the *next-hour weather conditions* (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) based on the *previous hourâ€™s data* using a deep learning model.  
We also built a *frontend web app* to make predictions easy and interactive.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Predicts *next-hour weather* from historical radar-based data  
- Uses *Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)* and *Deep Learning* models  
- Trained on our *own custom dataset*: [Radar Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohinigaddam/radderdataset1)  
- *Frontend UI* for real-time user input and predictions  
- Visualizes predicted vs. actual weather values
